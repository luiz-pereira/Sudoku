# Sudoku

Sudoku solver with computer vision.

This product was developed to grasp an understanding on how python works and how different it is from other languages.

The app is meant to be a backend exercise, so it doesn't have a friendly user interface.

It does mainly two things, it creates a random puzzle through mathematical calculations and then solves it with some simple algebraic calculations and iterations.

## Getting started

Install [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then dependencies with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
